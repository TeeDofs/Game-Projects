# Game-Projects
This repository contains all my game projects. In this repository I uploaded the project folders for all my unity games that I worked on. This repository is mostly filled with clones of classic games which I used to both learn and further my understanding of game development. They are not perfect and some of them have bugs and flaws, but they were made with my two hands so I am proud of them nonetheless. 

You need to watch out in the pac man clone, when pacman eats a power pellet all the ghosts start acting weird so maybe as an extra challenge try and finish the game without eating a power pellet. 

A lot of these games still need work and refinement as they are not considered finished products in my eyes, however since I used them mainly for learning and am currently working on my own original 2d platformer, I will return to refine them after I have accumulated more experience from developing my new game. 
Enjoy going through my portfoli and thank you for visiting !!!
